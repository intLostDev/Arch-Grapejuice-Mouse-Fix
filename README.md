# Grapejuice-Mouse-Fix
Fix for Grapejuce mouse.
This is just a python script that I made another script for for ease of access for noobs and so I can use it in my arch linux post install script simply cd to the directory you wish
git clone directory and do ./install.sh you may need to enable executing via chmod +x install.sh and then do ./install.sh but it is easy enough
